## Main Properties Of An Algorithm 
- Input- An algorithm must possess 0 or more well-defined inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.

- Output- An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs as desired.

- Correctness- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output.

- Definiteness-Algorithms should be clear and unambiguous, thus every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.

- Finiteness- The algorithm should have a finite number of steps that must be carried out to achieve the task at hand.

## Algorithmic Efficiency
There are two stages at which algorithmic efficiency is evaluated. You can think of this basically as one being a theoretical analysis and the other being practical.

- Priori Analysis. This is the theoretical evaluation in which factors such as processor speed are assumed to be constant and are not considered as having any effect on the algorithmic implementation.

- Posteriori Analysis. This is the practical evaluation carried out by implementing the algorithm using a selected programming language. The algorithm is then tested on a computer while observing the time taken and memore consumed.
